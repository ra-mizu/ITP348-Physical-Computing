# RGB LEDs

## Three LEDs in One!

* RGB LEDs combine three separate LEDs in one package
  - Red LED
  - Green LED
  - Blue LED
* These **primary colors** can be controlled separately to create a multitude of color possibilities

## Pins
<img src="lecture_rgb_leds.assets/1565897044440.png" alt="RGB LED" style="width:300px" />

* RGB LEDs have four pins
* Three pins to each of R, G, B *(shorter pins)*
* One pin serves as either common anode or common cathode *(longer pin)*

## Recall: Current Flow in LED

* LEDs allow current to flow **in only one direction**
* Positive voltage applied to the **anode**
* **Cathode** connected to Ground

## Current Flow in RGB LEDs 

* RGB LEDs operate in generall same way
* Current flows from anode to cathode
* Positive voltage on anode causes LED to turn on
* But there is a small catch to beware of...
  - There are two types of RGB LEDs



## Common Cathode Wiring

* R, G, B pins are **anode** (*positive*)
* Connect **cathode** (longer pin) to **Ground** (*negative*)
* Output **HIGH** (3.3v) on anode turns on, **LOW** turns off



## Common Cathode Wiring

## Common Cathode RGB LEDs

* ...are **physically** the opposite of regular LEDs
  * Regular LED: **anode** is longer pin
  * Common cathode RGB LED: **cathode** is longer pin
* ...are wired the same as regular LEDs
  * Connect anode to Argon
  * Output **HIGH** to turn on

## Common Anode Wiring

* R, G, B pins are **cathode** (*negative*)
* Connect **anode** (longer pin) to 3.3v (*positive*)
* Output **LOW** on anode to turn on LED; output **HIGH** (3.3v) to turn off

## Common Anode Wiring

## Common Anode RGB LEDs

* ...are **physically** the same as regular LEDs
  * LED: **anode** is longer pin
  * Common anode RGB LED: **anode** is longer pin
* ...are wired the opposite as regular LEDs
  * Connect anode to power
  * Output **LOW** to turn on

## Color Mixing

##### R + G + B = ?

## Color Mixing with RGB LEDs

* R + G + B **â‰ ** W
* Due to variations in manufacturing and resistor tolerances

## Lab (in three stages)

1) Wire an RGB LED and have it display random colors
2) Then create functions to change colors
3) Import `rgb-controls` library to animate colors

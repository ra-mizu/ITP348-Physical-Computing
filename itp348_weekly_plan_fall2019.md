#### General Feedback

* Assignment 0 is given out week 1, day 1; due week 2, day 2; that is the pattern
* change A1 blink so that it gives out code to make D7 blink, or change the name of the assignment to something like **initial project**
* Develop a way to post readings on website
* Try to integrate lectures, readings, assignments all on one webpage under "weeks"
* Add to Assignment 0 how to install fritzing parts for Argon (from Rob github)
